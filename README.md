# Mocha
### An IDE for Java written in Java.

Project goals:


0. Bootstrap off of IntelliJ. (the most basic goal, write the IDE in the IDE)
1. Get a text editor running.
2. Auto save and whatnot.
3. Get a file browser running.
4. Get tabs running.
5. Utilize gradle.
   - ``gradle -m`` OR ``gradle --dry-run`` can be used for getting errors
6. Some kind of cache for classes and methods. Maybe reflection can be used to index?
